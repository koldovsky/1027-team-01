            <p>Stick to the US Route 120 or 140, or to the US 41 if you travel from the
                South. When in Yosemite Park, turn left and drive about 15 minutes,
                then turn right on the crossroad, and you’ll see the Yosemite Village
                sign in 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>Buy a San Joaquins train ticket if you travel from San Francisco or
                Sacramento, and then change to the YARTS bus to get to the very
                Yosemite village, turn right from the bus stop and walk around 5
                minutes.</p>
